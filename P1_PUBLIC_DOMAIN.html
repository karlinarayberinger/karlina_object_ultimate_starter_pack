<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe the intellectual property which comprises this website (i.e. the website whose domain name is phonetically worded as <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>).</span></p>

<p><strong>FILE:</strong> a named sequence comprised of some natural number of binary digits which are arranged in exactly one order and which represents a particular piece of information which is verbatim transmissible as a sequence of ones and zeros.</p>
<p>An example of a file is the C++ source code file named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_ultimate_starter_pack/blob/main/factorial.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factorial.cpp</a> (which is used to compute N factorial (assuming that N is a sufficiently small natural number) by multiplying N by exactly one instance of each unique natural number which is less than N in the computer programming tutorial web page of this website named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/factorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FACTORIAL</a>).</p>

<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY:</strong> a collection of some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural number</a> of files.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>OPEN_SOURCE:</strong> an adjective which describes some piece of intellectual property as being legal for any person to make indefinitely many copies of, to distribute any of those copies (either freely or in exchange for money, valued products, or valued services) to any recipient, to include wholly or partially as part of one&#8217;s own intellectual property, or to claim as one&#8217;s own intellectual property.</p>
<p>Note that, if a person makes a copy of some piece of intellectual property which is licensed by that intellectual property&#8217;s original creator as being open source, then that copy is treated as its own separate piece of intellectual property (even though the source code which comprises the copy is identical to the source code which comprises the original). For example, if Person A publishes a piece of intellectual property named <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> and licenses that file as being open source, then Person B can legally make a copy of that file and either use the same file name for the copy file or else give that copy file a different name such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">B.cpp</strong> and either license that copy file as open source or else as some proprietary piece of intellectual property. (Person B&#8217;s copy of <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> does not legally change any of the attributes of Person A&#8217;s original <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> file (including the fact that Person A&#8217;s original <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> file is licensed as open source)).</p>
<p>Within the context of this website, the terms <strong>open source</strong> and <strong>public domain</strong> are used interchangeably. Public domain generally refers to ownerless intellectual property (and if some piece of intellectual property is labeled as being part of the public domain, then that piece of intellectual property can be legally treated as any person&#8217;s intellectual property).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the intellectual property which comprises each web page within this website (i.e. the website whose domain name is phonetically worded as <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is licensed by the author of this website (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer) as being open source.</span></p>
<p>Backed up versions of each one of the web pages in this website are available to view at <a style="background:#00ff00;color:#000000;" href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive dot Org</a> (and were saved to Archive dot Org using the WayBack Machine).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PROPRIETARY:</strong> an adjective which describes some piece of intellectual property as being illegal to use or to make copies of without permission from that intellectual property&#8217;s owner.</p>
<p>The owner(s) of some proprietary piece of intellectual property may or may not be the original creators of that piece of intellectual property. For example, if Person A publishes a piece of intellectual property named <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> and licenses that file as being open source, then Person B can legally make a copy of that file and license that copy file as being Person B&#8217;s own proprietary intellectual property (but Person B cannot legally remove the open source license from Person A&#8217;s <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">A.cpp</strong> file).</p>
<p>A person might want to license a piece of intellectual property as proprietary rather than open source in order to ensure that the person gets paid each time a customer downloads a copy of that intellectual property (and to prevent whoever downloads a copy of that intellectual property from making copies of that copy).</p>
