<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs describe how exactly one contiguous block of web page links which are displayed as linear sequence on the home page of this website are intended to refer to web pages which are intended to remain unchanged starting on 01_JANUARY_2023. In other words, the following paragraphs describe the mutability (or lack thereof) of the intellectual property which comprises the content of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this website</a> (i.e. the website whose domain name is phonetically worded as <strong>Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</strong>).</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The first 28 web pages of this website (excluding the home page (i.e. the web page named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">START_PAGE</a>)) are intended by the website author (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer) to remain unchanged (i.e. <strong>immutable</strong>) after the year 2022 ends.</p>
<p>Each one of the web pages which comprises this website is referenced on the home page of this website as a tuple consisting of a plain-text string (i.e. “PAGE_”concatenated to a nonnegative integer index number concatenated to “:”) and a hyperlink whose visible component is the corresponding web page name and whose hidden component is the web page <strong>URL</strong> (i.e. <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (i.e. web page address)) of that particular web page. Clicking on a hyperlink opens that hyperlink’s corresponding web page.</p>
<p>Each web page which is referenced on the <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home page</a> of this website has a unique index number.</p>
<p>The web pages which are referenced on the home page of this website are listed in ascending order such that the lowest index number is at the bottom of the list and the highest index number is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>To be precise, each one of the web page tuples which are displayed on the home page of this website has an index number which is one larger or else one smaller than the index number of each adjacent web page tuple in the list of tuples. In other words, the index numbers in that list of tuples are all of the nonnegative integers which are no larger than the highest web page tuple index number (and such numbers are listed in ascending order starting at the bottom list item and ending at the top list item).</p>

<p><strong><em>Why is this web page named DISCLAIMER?</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This web page is a disclaimer in the sense that it claims to not make certain claims. To be precise, the web pages which are set aside to be immutable after the year 2022 (i.e. the web pages whose home page index numbers are natural numbers less than or equal to 27) may contain statements which are later discovered by the website author to be factually inaccurate, stylistically outdated, or otherwise not up to par with the website author’s updated knowledge and preferences.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Each web page whose uniquely corresponding home page index number is a natural numbers less than or equal to 27 is a component of a particular historical artifact. That historical artifact is intended to be an immutable time capsule which preserves the website author’s mental model of reality during the year 2022 in a verbatim communicable format.</span></p>
<p>Web pages which the website author adds to this website whose home page index numbers are natural numbers equal to or larger than 28 are intended to be more mutable than are the web pages whose home page index numbers are natural numbers which are equal to or smaller than 27. <span style="background:#00ff00;">Unlike the web pages whose home page index numbers are integers no smaller than 1 and no larger than 27, the web pages whose index numbers are 0 or else some integer larger than or equal to 28 will be updated if the website author discovers that there are errors in the content of those web pages.</span></p>
