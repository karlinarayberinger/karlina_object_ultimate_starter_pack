<p><em>&#8220;The essential substrate which comprises each universe is immutably generative (i.e. unconditionally able to spawn indefinitely many phenomenally distinct patterns (and indefinitely many copies of each phenomenally distinct pattern)).&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</em></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs briefly introduce some epistemological assumptions about what constitutes and what controls physical and virtual reality. This web page is an elaboration of the concepts which are discussed in the web page of this website named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a>.</span></p>

<p>An electronic digital computer is relatively <strong>physical</strong> (i.e. comprised of matter, space, and energy) while the software that machine runs is relatively abstract (i.e. <strong>virtual</strong> (taking place inside of a physical universe as a smaller subset universe)).</p>
<p>(A <strong>universe</strong> is a succession of phenomena which takes place inside of at least one space-time continuum).</p>
<p>It may be possible for a sufficiently complex physical information processing machine to generate a software simulation which is a mirror of every atom and subatomic component inside of that physical machine. Likewise, it may be possible for a sufficiently complex software simulation to model any physical system.</p>
<pre>physical : abstract :: electronics : information</pre>
<p>Hypothetically speaking, the subjective experience which one information processing agent, S, experiences can be verbatim replicated inside of the subjective experience which some other information processing agent, T, experiences (and vice versa such that T simulates the space-time continuum which S experiences (either simultaneously or else asynchronously in relation to T) and S simulates the space-time continuum which T experiences (either simultaneously or else asynchronously in relation to S)).</p>
<p>S.render(T.render(X)) may or may not be the same phenomenal pattern as is T.render(S.render(X)).</p>
<p>If X is the phenomenal pattern represented by S.render(T.render(Y)), then X may or may not represent the same phenomenal pattern which Y represents (and Y is presumably occurring before X is occurring such that Y is a function of X if X (yet it is possible that X and Y are simultaneously occurring)).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Panpsychism</strong> is the hypothesis that all of reality (i.e. the whole of nature) is contained within exactly one boundless mind (which means that pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (and that pure consciousness is the substrate into which all phenomena are projected)).</p>
<p>One notion of panpsychism (<strong>A</strong>) suggests that nature contains infinitely many unique phenomena simultaneously and unconditionally (and that nature contains infinitely many phenomenally identical instances of each unique pattern simultaneously and unconditionally)).</p>
<p>Some other notion of panpsychism (<strong>B</strong>) suggests that nature contains a nonnegative integer number of unique phenomena simultaneously (and that nature contains a nonnegative integer number of each phenomenally unique pattern).</p>
<p>If A is true, then nature is static (i.e. unchanging) because, according to A, nature cannot encompass more or else less phenomena than what nature already contains.</p>
<p>By contrast, if B is true, then, according to B, nature is dynamic (i.e. changing) because phenomena appear and disappear as time elapses (in relation to the most macroscopic timeline in existence (i.e. nature’s frame of reference)) rather than be instantiated unconditionally.</p>
<p>B suggests that nature can grow, shrink, and rearrange the positioning of its contents.</p>
<p>A suggests that nature has exactly one size and is arranged in exactly one configuration unconditionally (and that nature has neither a temporal beginning nor a temporal ending).</p>
<p>A suggests that, from nature’s perspective, there is a phenomenal manifestation of each unique noumenon.</p>
<p>B suggests that, from nature’s perspective, not every (abstract) noumenon has a uniquely corresponding (physical) phenomenon.</p>
<pre>A : B :: infinite : finite</pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Pantheism</strong> is the hypothesis that God (i.e. the one and only hypothetical creator and controller of all phenomena) is ubiquitous rather than located somewhere outside of nature.</p>
<p><strong>Atheism</strong> is the hypothesis that nature was neither created by a metaphysical god nor is nature ever controlled by a metaphysical god (and that no metaphysical god existed prior to nature (which means that it is not necessary for nature to have a metaphysical creator nor a metaphysical controller in order for nature to exist)).</p>
<p>(The term <strong>metaphysical</strong> in the previous paragraph is an adjective which describes some noun as &#8220;existing outside of physical reality&#8221; and &#8220;not being limited by what scientists deem to be constraining laws of physics which control how matter and energy behaves in predictable and empirically measurable ways&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>Deism</strong> is the hypothesis that some metaphysical god caused pure nothingness to change from containing nothing but itself (i.e. pure noumena) to containing something other than itself (i.e. phenomena and noumena).</p>
<p><strong>Theism</strong> is an extension of deism which suggests that some metaphysical god controls how phenomena evolve in addition to causing phenomena to appear or to disappear.</p>
<p>(Deists generally believe that some metaphysical god does not intervene in physical events after a physical universe is constructed by that god. By contrast, theists generally believe that some metaphysical god intervenes at least some the time in terms of how events flow in chronological succession along some space-time continuum which at least one frame of reference renders).</p>
