// Declare a pointer to a pointer to an int-sized block of memory.
int ** B;

Enter a natural number value, S, which is no larger than 1000 (and which will be used as the number of elements to include in an array of random integers): 

S := 100.

Enter a natural number value, T, which is no larger than 1000 (and which will be used as the maximum number of unique states which each array element may represent): 

T := 10.

// Allocate S consecutive int-sized blocks of memory to the instantiation of array A.
// A is a pointer which stores the address of the first memory cell of that chunk of S consecutive int-sized blocks of memory.
A = new int[S];
