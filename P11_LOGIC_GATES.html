<p>The following statements enumerate all the permutations of the logic gates named AND, OR, and NOT. (In the context of electronic circuits, <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AND</a> is represented by a series circuit, <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR_gate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OR</a> is represented by a parallel circuit, and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOT</a> is represented by an inverter).</p>
<p>AND(0,0) = 0.</p>
<p>AND(0,1) = 0.</p>
<p>AND(1,0) = 0.</p>
<p>AND(1,1) = 1.</p>
<p>OR(0,0) = 0.</p>
<p>OR(0,1) = 1.</p>
<p>OR(1,0) = 1.</p>
<p>OR(1,1) = 1.</p>
<p>NOT(0) = 1.</p>
<p>NOT(1) = 0.</p>
