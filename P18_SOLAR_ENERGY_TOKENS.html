<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe a system of money whose notion of economic value is directly proportional to the number of watts of electricity produced by solar cells (and each of those solar cells expire 12 &#8220;months&#8221; after being created). The name of the type of system described in this web page is <strong>Solar Energy Tokens Economy</strong>. A particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy may exist on a single satellite, an entire planet, or some other structure which exists inside of a finite allocation of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time</a>.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>N:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of persons which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and a <strong>person</strong> is a &#8220;sufficiently intelligent&#8221; <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> (and each person which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy owns exactly one uniquely corresponding Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account)).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>E:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watts</a> of electricity which are generated from each one of the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photovoltaic cells</a> which sustain exactly one Solar Energy Tokens Economy during a particular &#8220;month&#8221; (and one <strong>&#8220;month&#8221;</strong> is exactly 30 days (and each <strong>day</strong> is exactly 24 hours (and each <strong>hour</strong> is exactly 60 minutes (and each <strong>minute</strong> is exactly 60 <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seconds</a>)))).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>S:</strong> a fixed <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural number</a> of watts of electricity which are used to produce exactly one Solar Energy Token (and a <strong>Solar Energy Token</strong> is a unit of abstract economic exchange (i.e. money) within a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and each Solar Energy Token is represented by exactly one unique and finite sequence of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/binary_to_decimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> across a network of digital computers)).</p>
<p>A unit of <strong>money</strong> is exactly one of some natural number of abstract objects which are used to symbolically represent desired products and services. Within the context of the economies described in this web page, each Solar Energy Token Bank Account owner may trade some natural number of Solar Energy Tokens for a particular desired product or service whose price is equivalent to that natural number of Solar Energy Tokens.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">In order to prevent the subjective value of each Solar Energy Token from depreciating within a Solar Energy Tokens Economy as the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within that economy approaches <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinity</a>, each Solar Energy Token expires 12 &#8220;months&#8221; after that particular Solar Energy Token was generated. Once a particular Solar Energy Token expires, the unique binary digits sequence associated with that Solar Energy Token may be recycled as the unique identifier for some new Solar Energy Token.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>T:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of Solar Energy Tokens which were yielded from the E watts of electricity which were generated during a particular &#8220;month&#8221; within a particular Solar Energy Token Economy (and T is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing E by S).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>W:</strong> the minimum natural number of Solar Energy Tokens to deposit into each one of the N Solar Energy Token bank accounts within a particular Solar Energy Economy at transition point between two &#8220;months&#8221; (and W is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing T by N).</p>
