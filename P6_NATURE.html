<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived as containing specific features (and those features are comprised of some <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a>, <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>, <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a>, and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a>).</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is the observation of the color <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">red</strong> by human brains which are processing input signals from optic nerves detecting light whose wavelengths are approximately 700 nanometers. (Where the color red is being observed by some partial frame of reference is where other colors such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#0000ff;">blue</strong> and <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">green</strong> are not simultaneously being observed by that same partial frame of reference).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>OMNISCIENT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders all phenomena simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>panpsychism hypothesis</strong>, the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness (and that ubiquitous field of consciousness renders each phenomenon simultaneously and immutably such that no phenomenon appears to be a noumenon according to that omniscient frame of reference).</p>
<p>According to the pansychism hypothesis, pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous and featureless substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PARTIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders some phenomena but not all phenomena.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>For example, while a partial frame of reference named A renders a finite set of phenomena named X, another partial frame of reference named B renders a finite set of phenomena named Y (and X and Y are phenomenally distinct). From A&#8217;s perspective, Y is a noumenon while X is a phenomenon. From B&#8217;s perspective, X is a noumenon while Y is a phenomenon.</p>
<p>One assumption (which is an extension of the pansychism hypothesis) about nature is that nature contains every imaginable phenomenon (and every imaginable chronological sequence of phenomena) and that nature itself is one all-encompassing mind which, from the most macroscopic level possible, makes no distinction between a phenomenon and its respective noumenon because every phenomenon exists immutably and timelessly inside of exactly one all-encompassing <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a> (and each chronological sequence of phenomena exists inside of its own <strong>solipsistic</strong> (i.e. hermetically sealed off from any information outside of itself) <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universe</a>). Such a multiverse would contain <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many phenomenally distinct universes.</p>
