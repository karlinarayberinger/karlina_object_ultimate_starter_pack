<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived as containing specific features (and those features are observed as being finite quantities of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a> and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> a particular allocation of pure nothingness which renders a particular set of phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PARTIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders some phenomena but not all phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>OMNISCIENT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders all phenomena simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to some interpretations of the previous sentence, an omniscient frame of reference renders every partial frame of reference simultaneously.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>For example, while a partial frame of reference named A renders a finite set of phenomena named X, another partial frame of reference named B renders a finite set of phenomena named Y (and X and Y are phenomenally distinct). From A&#8217;s perspective, Y is a noumenon while X is a phenomenon. From B&#8217;s perspective, X is a noumenon while Y is a phenomenon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM:</strong> the hypothesis which suggests that the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness (and that ubiquitous field of consciousness is synonymous with pure nothingness).</p>
<p>According to some variations of panpsychism, there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders each phenomenon simultaneously and immutably (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness is an omniscient frame of reference).</p>
<p>According to some variations of panpsychism, there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders every imaginable phenomenon simultaneously and immutably (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness renders infinitely many distinct phenomena).</p>
