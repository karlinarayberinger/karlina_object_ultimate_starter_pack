<p>In the diagram above, several types of hypothetical multiverses are depicted. Each bounded region filled with exactly one color represents exactly one space-time continuum (i.e. universe) which is either finite or else infinite in duration. Nested bounded regions depict the process of exactly one frame of reference abruptly transitioning from one space-time continuum to some other space-time continuum (such that an inner bounded region expands to become its neighboring outer bounded region).</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled D is a series of space-time continuums which evolves as time elapses to never repeat the same phenomena.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled A is a series of space-time continuums which repeats the same phenomena after a finite amount of time elapses in a cyclical manner.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled G is a space-time (i.e. universe) continuum which encompasses two multiverses simultaneously which are phenomenally indistinguishable from each other and which are each phenomenally similar to D.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled F is a space-time continuum (i.e. universe) encompassing two multiverses simultaneously which are phenomenally distinguishable from each other such that one of those multiverses is a looping sequence of phenomena (similar to A) while the other multiverse is a diverging sequence of phenomena (similar to D).</p>
