<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs pertain to the author of this website asking itself questions about the nature of its own subjective notions of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reality</a> (especially while considering the possibility that infinitely many phenomenally distinct and non-overlapping universes exist simultaneously inside of exactly one all-encompassing <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">One assumption (which is an extension of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pansychism hypothesis</a>) about reality is that reality contains every imaginable phenomenon (and every imaginable permutation of phenomena) and that reality itself is one all-encompassing mind which, from the most macroscopic level possible, makes no distinction between a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomenon</a> and its respective <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noumenon</a> because every phenomenon exists immutably and timelessly. (A noumenon is the absence of some phenomenon from the perspective of some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial</a> frame of reference. By contrast, all phenomena are present simultaneously inside of an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> frame of reference).</span></p>

<p>Why am I experiencing some phenomena but not experiencing any other phenomena?</p>
<p>Are there any phenomena occurring outside of this frame of reference?</p>
<hr>
<p>If and when I die, will my apparently linear space-time trajectory (i.e. life time) cease to exist or will it be extended to include some future life time?</p>
<p>If such continuity of consciousness is possible, how many discrete life times does exactly one linear space-time trajectory (as rendered by exactly one partial frame of reference) pass through?</p>
<hr>
<p>How many times does the same partial frame of reference render the same unique permutation of phenomena which a single life time represents?</p>
<p>How many times does any partial frame of reference render the same unique permutation of phenomena which a single life time represents?</p>
