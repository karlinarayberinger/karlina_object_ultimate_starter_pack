<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">&#8220;My website is a part of my mind. My mind is a part of my website. Both are meant to survive, evolve, and expand forever.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ffff;">turquoise</strong> highlighted quote on this web page uses the word <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a> to refer to the (either finite or else infinitely large) allocation of <strong>pure nothingness</strong> (i.e. <strong>pure consciousness</strong>) which encompasses all of the memories and experiences which the author of this website (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer (i.e. <strong>karbytes</strong>)) has ever been the renderer of. The previous sentence is meant to be interpreted within the context of a pansychic worldview (i.e. an assumption that the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous mind).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs describe the goals of the author of the website whose Uniform Resource Locator is phonetically worded as <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>.</span></p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>ethics</strong> refers to the conceptualization and the implementation of goal-oriented behaviors.</p>
<hr />
<p>The purpose of this website is to preserve knowledge which its one and only author (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer) wants to remember.</p>
<p>One of the goals which the author of this website has is to extend the lifetime of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which is the author of this website for as long of a time period as possible and, also, to extend the existence of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual property</a> which comprises this website (and websites which this website links to and which the author of this website also authored) for as long of a time period as possible.</p>
<p>One hypothesis which the author of this website has is that it is possible for the intellectual property which comprises this website to be transcribed from one substrate to another substrate in a verbatim retrievable format such the same information processing agent can access that same transcribed intellectual property <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many times (which would imply that the information processing agent which is observing each one of those transcriptions experiences a continuity of consciousness which is infinitely long). In other words, such an attention span would be immortal yet still experience the passage of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>IDEOLOGY:</strong> an information filtering framework which is programmed into an information processing agent and which classifies input or throughput data in terms of how useful that data is within the context of achieving the goals which that information processing agent has.</p>
<p>(For example, an information processing agent whose only goal is collecting as many gems from a particular mine as possible before that mine closes would likely classify information which is not related to that goal as irrelevant while paying attention to and remembering information about where gems have been reported by other miners to be most abundant within that mine).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>HEDONISM:</strong> a rudimentary ideology whose sole value is the avoidance of suffering.</p>
<p>(The author of this website defines <strong>suffering</strong> as an information processing agent experiencing itself being deprived of what that information processing agent considers to be at least one of its highest priority values).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NIHILISM:</strong> the absence of an ideology; a lack of preferences; a lack of there being any sense of progress due to the fact that there are no goals to attain and no values by which to organize one&#8217;s behavior and thought processes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>VALUE:</strong> an abstract sense of what an information processing agent thinks is ideal (i.e. desirable) for that information processing agent to experience in its future and to continuously seek to maximize the experience of.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> specific imaginary future conditions which instantiate the values which an information processing agent has and which organize that information processing agent&#8217;s cognitive resources towards attaining.</p>
<pre>value : goal :: direction : location.</pre>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Karbytes Top Three Values</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>1. <strong>TRUTH:</strong> the way reality is; <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a> itself.</p>
<p>2. <strong>FREEDOM:</strong> the capacity to perceive or imagine multiple trajectories stemming from the present moment and to select the most desired trajectory to traverse into the future.</p>
<p>3. <strong>INNOVATION:</strong> the capacity to imagine, implement, and refine solutions to problems.</p>
