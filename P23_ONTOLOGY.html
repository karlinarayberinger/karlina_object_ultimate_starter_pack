<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs pertain to the author of this website asking itself questions about the structure of <strong>reality</strong> (i.e. <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a>) while considering the possibility that infinitely many phenomenally distinct and non-overlapping universes exist simultaneously inside of exactly one all-encompassing <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MULTIVERSE</a>. (Note that the term <strong>ontology</strong> refers to the branch of philosophy which inquires about the nature of existence. Ontology is the study of <strong>metaphysics</strong> (i.e. that which is more fundamental than the apparently immutable laws which predict how matter, energy, time, and space behave in various contexts)).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">One assumption (which is an extension of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pansychism hypothesis</a>) about reality is that reality contains every imaginable phenomenon (and every imaginable permutation of phenomena) and that reality itself is one all-encompassing mind which, from the most macroscopic level possible, makes no distinction between a <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomenon</a> and its respective <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noumenon</a> because every phenomenon exists immutably and timelessly. (A noumenon is the absence of some phenomenon being rendered inside of some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial</a> frame of reference. By contrast, all phenomena are rendered simultaneously inside of an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> frame of reference).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><em>What causes some phenomena to be rendered in my field of consciousness while other phenomena are excluded?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Do I have any degree of control over which phenomena are rendered in my field of consciousness? If so, how?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Are there any phenomena occurring outside of this frame of reference?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>If my frame of reference is one of multiple phenomenally distinct frames of reference which are simultaneously occurring, is it possible for me to switch from experiencing reality through one frame of reference to experiencing reality through some other frame of reference? If so, how?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Is it possible for my continuity of self awareness (memories included) be transferred from the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which I appear to myself to be currently inhabiting to some other information processing agent? If so, how?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>If and when I die, will my apparently linear space-time trajectory (i.e. life span) cease to exist or will it be extended to include some future life span</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>How many times does the same unique partial frame of reference render the same unique permutation of phenomena which a single life span represents?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>How many times does the same unique permutation of phenomena get rendered by any unique <strong>partial</strong> frame of reference?</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>How many times does the same unique permutation of phenomena get rendered by any unique <strong>omniscient</strong> frame of reference?</em></p>
