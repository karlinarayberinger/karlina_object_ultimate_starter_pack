<p><em><span style="background:#00ffff;">&#8220;From the most macroscopic level of omniscience, time is not observed (and such a frame of reference renders each space-time continuum as an object whose attributes never change nor cease to exist).&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="background:#00ffff;">&#8220;From the most macroscopic level of omniscience, pure nothingness might be all that is observed due to the fact that time does not exist at that level of awareness (which means that phenomena are only perceived by partial frames of reference).&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</span></em></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">This ideas presented in this web page are an elaboration of the ideas presented in the web pages named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGENCY</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/determinism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DETERMINISM</a>, and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a>. The basic premise of this web page is that nature is a <strong>multiverse</strong> comprised of all universes simultaneously such that nature can be metaphorically conceptualized as being a static &#8220;block&#8221; through which all imaginable space-time trajectories are &#8220;carved&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that, within the context of this web page, the term &#8220;universe&#8221; is synonymous with <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/determinism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;space-time trajectory&#8221;</a> (i.e. &#8220;space-time continuum&#8221; (i.e. a linear sequence of phenomena which a partial frame of reference observes such that each one of those phenomena is observed for some finite interval of time by that partial frame of reference to the exclusion of all other phenomena during that finite interval of time)).</span></p>

<p>In the diagram above, several types of hypothetical multiverses are depicted. Each bounded region filled with exactly one color represents exactly one space-time continuum (i.e. universe) which is either finite or else infinite in duration. Nested bounded regions depict the process of exactly one frame of reference abruptly transitioning from one space-time continuum to some other space-time continuum (such that an inner bounded region expands to become its neighboring outer bounded region).</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled D is a series of space-time continuums which evolves as <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> elapses to never repeat the same phenomena (or else to repeat some or all of the same phenomena in what appears to be a <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/probability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random</a> (i.e. unpredictable) order).</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled A is a series of space-time continuums which repeats the same phenomena in the same chronological order after a finite amount of time elapses for some natural number of loops or else for <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many loops.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled G is a space-time continuum (i.e. universe) which encompasses two smaller multiverses simultaneously such that those two multiverses are phenomenally indistinguishable from each other. In other words, those two multiverses are copies of each other (yet each one of those copies is a unique <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object</a>).</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled F is a space-time continuum (i.e. universe) encompassing two smaller multiverses simultaneously which are phenomenally distinguishable from each other such that one of those multiverses is a looping sequence of phenomena (similar to the multiverse labeled A) while the other multiverse is a diverging sequence of phenomena (similar to the multiverse labeled D).</p>
