<p><strong>OBJECT:</strong> a finite allocation of space, time, matter, and energy which is configured to store exactly one pattern.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PATTERN:</strong> a finite sequence of contrasting phenomena which may be copied from a source substrate to a target substrate.</p>
<p>An example of a pattern is the following binary term (i.e. byte): 11011011.</p>
<p>Each binary digit which comprises the pattern 11011011 is a copy of the pattern 0 or else 1.</p>
<p>If 11011011 is interpretted as a base-two nonnegative integer by some information processing agent, then according to that information processing agent, 11011011 represents exactly one uniquely corresponding base-ten nonnegative integer (i.e. 219) using an algebraic function to map a particular base-two nonnegative integer input value to exactly one uniquely and logically corresponding base-ten nonnegative integer output value.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IDENTITY:</strong> exactly one pattern or else exactly one web of symbolic assocations between multiple distinct patterns which is used to describe exactly one uniquely corresponding object such that the described object is distinguishable from all other objects within some context.</p>
<p>An example of a piece of information which may be used as the identity for exactly one particular software object which is generated inside of exactly one runtime instance of a computer program (as a result of some digital computer translating a collection of C++ source code files into machine executable instructions (and those machine-executable instructions physically manifest as a sequence of &#8220;ON&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;sufficiently high voltage&#8221; (symbolized by the token 1)) and &#8220;OFF&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;insufficiently high voltage&#8221; (symbolized by the token 0)) signals within the digital computer&#8217;s hardware circuitry)) is the address of the first byte-sized memory cell of some contiguous and finite allocation of byte-sized memory cells within the digital computer&#8217;s hardware circuitry which stores the described software object from the moment the object is created to the moment that object is deleted.</p>
<p>For the duration of object X&#8217;s lifespan, no other object can occupy the memory cells which are allocated to X. Therefore, the first memory cell of the contiguous block of memory cells which are allocated to X is uniquely associated with X and not with some other object which is generated within the same program runtime instance in which X is instantiated.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TOKEN:</strong> a unique and finite allocation of space, time, matter, and energy into which a symbol is inscribed.</p>
<p>11011011 is a sequence of exactly eight unique tokens (and each of those tokens has inscribed within it exactly one of two symbols (i.e. the binary digits 0 and 1)).</p>
<p>Each one of the eight tokens which comprises the binary digit sequence 11011011 has a unique position (i.e. nonnegative integer array index) within that sequence.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SYMBOL:</strong> a finite pattern which is physically manifested as token and which is used to represent exactly one uniquely corresponding piece of abstract information.</p>
<p>Within the sequence 11011011, the token whose array index is 0 and the token whose array index is 1 each logically represent the same abstract piece of information (i. e. the nonnegative integer quantity one). By contrast, the token whose array index is 2 and the the token whose array index is 5 each logically represent the same abstract piece of information (i.e. the nonnegative integer quantity zero).</p>
<p>The pattern 1 (which is relatively physical (i.e. phenomenal)) may be used as a symbol to logically represent exactly one uniquely corresponding piece of information (which is relatively abstract (i.e. noumenal)).</p>
<pre>physical : abstract :: phenomenon : noumenon.
physical : abstract :: substrate : pattern.
physical : abstract :: software : hardware.
relatively_physical : relatively_abstract :: finite : infinite.
relatively_physical : relatively_abstract :: token : symbol.
relatively_physical : relatively_abstract :: number : equation.
