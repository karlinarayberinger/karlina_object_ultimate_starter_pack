<p>MULTIVERSE:</p>
<p>&#8211; Multiple frames of reference which appear to inhabit the same universe seem to experience unique rates of time passing.</p>
<p>&#8211; Solipsism is the perception and/or belief that there exists only one frame of reference for the duration of that frame of reference&#8217;s existence.</p>
<p>&#8211; According to the &#8220;many world&#8217;s hypothesis&#8221;, there are as many parallel universes as there are unique outcomes to every decision (and one universe splits into multiple universes when a decision is made).</p>
