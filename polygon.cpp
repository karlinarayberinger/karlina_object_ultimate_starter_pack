/**
 * The default POLYGON constructor sets the color value to some arbitrary value.
 * 
 * Note that the POLYGON cannot be instantiated as an object which takes
 * up some allotment of physical memory because the POLYGON class is
 * abstract. 
 * 
 * This constructor is implemented only by classes which are
 * descendents of the POLYGON class.
 * 
 * It is possible, however, to make POLYGON-type pointers which
 * store the memory of objects which are instantiated from classes
 * which are derived from the POLYGON class. (See the example below).
