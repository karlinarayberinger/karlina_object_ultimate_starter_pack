<p>Why am I in this frame of reference and not in any other other frame of reference?</p>
<p>Is it possible for me to switch from one frame of reference to another and, if so, how?</p>
<p>Is the universe I am living inside of solely the product of my mind while everything else in it is just what my mind concocts or is there something occurring outside of my awareness?</p>
<p>If and when I die, will my apparently linear space-time trajectory (one in potentially infinitely many partial frame of references) cease to exist or will it continue into my next life time? If such reincarnation is possible, how many discrete life times does exactly one linear space-time trajectory (as rendered by exactly one partial frame of reference) pass through?</p>
