<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived as containing specific features.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is the observation of the color <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">red</strong> by human brains which are processing input signals from optic nerves detecting light whose wavelengths are approximately 700 nanometers. (Where the color red is being observed by some partial frame of reference is where other colors such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#0000ff;">blue</strong> and <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">green</strong> are not simultaneously being observed by that same partial frame of reference).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>OMNISCIENT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders all phenomena simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/panpsychism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the panpsychic hypothesis</a>, the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness (and that ubiquitous field of consciousness renders each phenomenon simultaneously and immutably such that no phenomenon appears to be a noumenon according to that omniscient frame of reference).</p>
<p>According to the pansychic hypothesis, pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PARTIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders some phenomena but not all phenomena.</p>
<p>An omniscient frame of reference would render what each partial frame of reference would render.</p>
<p>What one partial frame of reference renders as a phenomenon is what some other partial frame of reference &#8220;renders&#8221; as a noumenon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>Some interpretations of the panpsychic hypothesis posit that each imaginable phenomenon exists immutably inside of its own solipsistic universe such that, from nature&#8217;s omniscient perceptive, phenomena are indistinguishable from noumena (because each noumenon is rendered as a phenomenon inside of at least one partial frame of reference (and each partial frame of reference is considered to be a unique solipsistic universe concurring with all other imaginable solipsistic universes inside of exactly one all-encompassing <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a>)).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous and featureless substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
