<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a> as being a static “block” which contains all decision-making trajectories.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>STATIC:</strong> an adjective which describes some partition of nature as not changing according to some frame of reference observing that partition of nature.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>CHANGE:</strong> a noun which describes some frame of reference observing a particular phenomenon either emerging out of pure nothingness or else disappearing into pure nothingness.</p>
<p>In order for change to be observed, the same allocation of space being observed must be observed for some interval of time whose length is a nonzero quantity.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that change, and therefore the passage of time, is perceptible from a partial frame of reference but not from an omniscient frame of reference because an omniscient frame of reference would observe all phenomena as occurring simultaneously and, hence,  timelessly. Therefore, in order for an omniscient frame of reference to perceive change (and, hence, experience the passage of time), that omniscient frame of reference must &#8220;zoom into&#8221; exactly one of many partial frames of reference and trade omniscience for partiality.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SPACE_TIME_CONTINUUM:</strong> a linear and unidirectional succession of some natural number of (or else infinitely many) timeless snapshots of apparently one finite allocation of space.</p>
<p>A phenomenon occurring within a particular space-time continuum which does not appear to change as time elapses within that space-time continuum is considered to be a static phenomenon (according to the frame of reference which renders that space-time continuum).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UNIVERSE:</strong> exactly one space-time continuum which exactly one frame of reference appears to itself to be inhabiting (and which that frame of reference is rendering).</p>
<p>According to the frame of reference which is rendering a particular universe, that frame of reference is static while the phenomena which comprises that universe is changing.</p>
<p>If more than one universe exists, then a frame of reference which renders exactly one universe while not rendering any other universes is considered to be <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial</a> rather than omniscient.</p>
<p>If more than one universe exists, then a frame of reference which simultaneously renders each one of those universes is considered to be <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> rather than partial.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">If an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> (which is the source of exactly one frame of reference per timeless instant along exactly one corresponding space-time continuum) named K perceives its environment as containing more than one information processing agent, then every information processing agent which is not K and which K perceives as existing in the same universe as K is merely a phenomenon (according to K) occurring inside of K&#8217;s frame of reference regardless of whether or not any of those other information processing agents inhabits (and renders) its own solipsistic universe. While K is confined to its own frame of reference, K cannot determine whether or not any other frames of reference exist. If each of those information processing agents which K observes as being external to K projects its own uniquely corresponding frame of reference, then the universe in which K inhabits is a <strong>compound universe</strong> (i.e. a universe which contains multiple universes inside of it and vice versa).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>MULTIVERSE:</strong> the set which contains all universes.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there is exactly one immutable multiverse (and that multiverse may contain zero universes, some natural number of universes, or else indefinitely many universes).</p>
<p>If the words ensconced inside of this web page are currently being observed by any frame of reference, then at least one universe exists (and the words ensconced inside of this web page are composed of space, time, matter, and energy rather than being composed exclusively of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pure nothingness</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>MANY_WORLDS_HYPOTHESIS:</strong> the theory that more than one universe exists and that one universe branches into multiple phenomenally distinct universes whenever a decision is made inside of a parent universe.</p>
<p>A <strong>decision</strong> is a process which enables change to occur. From the context of a computer program, a decision is made when some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> receives some finite piece of informational input and uses that informational input to determine which finite piece of informational output from a list of multiple informational outputs to select as the one and only output. For example, if a computer program receives an input named X and that input represents the integer 2, then, if the decision making algorithm is a function which takes any X as an input and which yields exactly one logically corresponding output named Y (and that function is <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">Y := f(X) = X + 1</strong>), then the outcome to that decision is 3 (and not any other piece of information such as 4 or 5).</p>
<p>The following hypothetical scenario illustrates what the many worlds hypothesis models: Suppose some information processing agent is traveling through a maze and reaches a point in the maze where one path branches into two distinct paths. Suppose then that the information processing agent uses an algorithmic process of elimination to decide which one of those two paths is most useful to that information processing agent&#8217;s goals to traverse. If the information processing agent decides to traverse the left path, then, according to the many world&#8217;s hypothesis, in some parallel universe, a parallel version of that information processing agent has chosen to traverse the right path instead of the left path. </p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">According to some variations of the many worlds hypothesis, the total number of parallel universes which stem from a common origin universe after an information processing agent inhabiting (or, more accurately, projecting) that origin universe makes a decision is the number of options which that information processing agent apparently could have selected exactly one of during that decision-making process.</span></p>
