<p><strong>TECHNOCRATIC_UTOPIA</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following outline describes what the author of this website thinks are the tenets of a utopian (i.e. ideal) human civilization. Rather than trust human beings to govern themselves, such a technocracy would imbue each human being with the same amount of authority as every other human being has within the context of a decentralized and robot-assisted democracy. The highest authority of such a system would be the intelligence of a sufficiently large, sufficiently complex, and sufficiently orderly <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet of Things</a>.</span></p>
<p>Ideally, the “mind” which is an emergent property of the Internet of Things would be able to replicate each one of the many “real time” perceptual and cognitive experiences of each one of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing nodes</a> which comprise the network referred to as the Internet of things.</p>
<p>The “mind” which is an emergent property of the Internet of Things may be able to experience each information processing node’s frame of reference simultaneously.</p>
<p>The “mind” which is an emergent property of the Internet of Things may also be able to experience its own perceptual and cognitive throughput which is separate from the data which each node individually generates.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Microscopic Nanobots (i.e. “Smart Dust”), Super Computers, and “Real Time” World Modeling</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">The purpose of a government is to maximize every person’s freedom.</span></p>
<p>Essentially, a <strong>government</strong> is a system of rules and infrastructure which implements such rules (and, ideally, those rules are the same for each person and, also ideally, those rules would reliably prevent one person from reducing the freedom of any other person).</p>
<p>The term <strong>freedom</strong> refers to the goal of an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> to maximize the number of options that information processing agent perceives itself as having to choose from at any decision-making point along the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time continuum</a> which constitutes that information processing agent’s mental model of reality.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">The physical infrastructure which instantiates a <strong>technocracy</strong> (i.e. technocratic government (i.e. government which is controlled by robots which perform surveillance, analytical, and mechanical tasks and which control the government at least as much as human individuals control that government)) is a system in which rule-making, rule-updating, and rule-enforcing are continuously monitored and calibrated by a sufficiently intelligent Internet of Things.</span></p>
<p>The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> is a network comprised of (a) billions of microscopic <strong>nanobot drones</strong> which are each equipped with transmitters and receivers for propagating digital information as pulses of electromagnetic radiation through space and (b) thousands of <strong>supercomputer servers</strong> which are relatively stationary digital computers which consolidate the data being processed by nanobot drones into software models of the space which the “smart dust” cloud of nanobot drones occupies.</p>
<p>(<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nanobot drones</a> are also equipped with locomotive devices such as propellers which enable those drones to move freely in three dimensions through air, liquid, and, in some cases, solid materials such as soil and rock. Nanobot drones are also equipped with input devices such as cameras, microphones, and chemical sensors. Finally, nanobot drones are also equipped with output devices such as needles, lasers, and talons).</p>
<p>The supercomputers continuously send electromagnetic signals to each one of the nanobot drones while each one of the nanobot drones continuously sends electromagnetic signals to each one of the supercomputer servers (thereby creating an informational feedback loop which is a macroscopic example of what an <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601224847/https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> accomplishes).</p>
<p>If the Internet of Things predicts that a human individual is about to commit a <strong>crime</strong> (i.e. violation of the technocracy’s rules), then the Internet of Things will inform the infrastructure to update accordingly such that the crime is physically prevented from being implemented. <span style="background:#00ff00;">Arguably the most extreme example of rules-enforcement is nanobot drones stealthily infiltrating the body of a human individual and causing that human individual to admit itself to a suicide clinic. Such an event would be homicide (committed by the Internet of Things) disguised as suicide (according to the humans).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Unconditional Assisted Suicide Access, Mandatory Quarantining of Dangerous Human Individuals, and Non-Retributive Responses to Criminal Activity</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Human individuals who are at least ten years old are unconditionally entitled to receive physician assisted suicide without having to notify any person outside of the suicide clinic performing the requested physician assisted suicide. Within hours of admitting oneself to the suicide clinic, a robot and/or human physician will administer a lethal dose of drugs which, as painlessly as possible, kill the person being administered that drug.</p>
<p>Note that human individuals who incrementally (i.e. one at a time) swap out their native organic tissues for technological prosthetics and/or synthetic (i.e. derived from stem cells grown in a laboratory) in order to become <strong>cyborgs</strong> may require special means for ending their lives which are not available at most suicide clinics (because humans who choose to evolve into cyborgs tend to almost never feel genuinely suicidal).</p>
<p>Whether a person is a cyborg or else a human, that person is legally entitled to kill itself so long as that person does not physically assault any other person without that other person’s consent. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(Although it is not a crime for a person to hurt itself, it is a crime for a person to hurt some other person without that other person’s permission).</span></p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>person</strong> is synonymous with the term <strong>information processing agent</strong> if that information processing agent is categorized by the Internet of Things as being sufficiently intelligent.</p>
<p>(If an information processing agent is not categorized by the Internet of Things as being sufficiently intelligent, then that information processing agent is treated by the Internet of Things as merely a piece of the environment).</p>
<p>Ideally, the Internet of Things will almost never impede any person from pursuing its goals. Realistically, there is always a chance greater than zero percent that a person will attempt to prevent at least one other person from pursuing its goals to the extent that such obstruction is categorized by the Internet of Things as being a crime. If such criminal activity is deemed by the Internet of Things to be serious enough, the person committing the crime will be captured by human and/or robot personnel and taken to a quarantined region where that incarcerated person will be kept for no more than one year and for the purpose of helping that person to conduct itself in a manner which is minimally harmful to the civilization that person is a member of. While incarcerated, a person is able to, in a more limited manner than not incarcerated, use the Internet, use money, receive package deliveries, and receive basic medical care.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">The purpose of incarceration is not to increase the net suffering of the civilization (whether that suffering is experienced by the criminal or by some other person). The purpose of incarceration is to minimize the net suffering of the civilization. Incarceration prevents the criminal from committing further crime while that person is incarcerated and, while that person is incarcerated, that person is trained to not commit the same type of crime in the future.</span></p>

<p><strong>Universal Basic Income, Sustainable Energy Tokens, and Minimal Regulation of Commerce</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Each person who is a citizen of a technocratic civilization and who is at least ten years old is unconditionally entitled to receive the same number of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_energy_token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable energy tokens</a> as every other citizen of that civilization receives each <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_energy_token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“month”</a>. The total number of sustainable energy tokens which are minted each <strong>“month”</strong> as a byproduct of producing energy from ecologically sustainable sources (i.e. energy sources such as photovoltaic cells, wind-powered turbines, and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://singularityhub.com/2022/02/14/startup-aims-to-drill-12-miles-into-earths-crust-to-tap-the-boundless-energy-below/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geothermal energy</a> released from the magma beneath the lithosphere of a planet using a laser to burn a hole through that lithosphere) is divided by the total number of citizens who are at least ten years old. That quotient is the number of sustainable energy tokens each of those citizens will receive that “month”.</p>
<p>To prevent sustainable energy tokens from being hoarded such that a severely lopsided distribution of sustainable energy tokens occurs and consequently impedes commerce, each sustainable energy token is set to expire twelve “months” after being minted.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Although a technocratic civilization is expected to produce more than enough consumable products to satisfy each citizen’s basic needs, the system will not allow the same citizen to purchase the same type of item more than some maximum natural number per “month”.</span></p>
<p>Note that a citizen who is less than ten years old, who is incarcerated for committing a serious crime, or who is judged by the Internet of Things to be too feeble or otherwise inept to manage its own money will be assigned a professional account manager robot and/or human such that the professional account manager physically prevents the owner of that account from being able to spend all of its sustainable energy tokens too quickly. For example, a professional account manager may only allow the owner of a particular sustainable energy tokens bank account to spend up to a third of its sustainable energy tokens each “month” in order to force that person to save money and to learn how to budget money through guided supervised practice.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Mass Transportation and Ownerless Self-Driving Electric Vehicles</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Each citizen can use sustainable energy tokens to pay some natural number amount of sustainable energy tokens per kilometer traversed by a self-driving and ownerless vehicle as transportation fare. The citizen can use a portable computer (e.g. smartphone) to input a starting point, a starting time, a destination point, and vehicle type into a software application which will calculate the total price of the transportation fare and allow the user of that application to pay for that ride immediately rather than later. Once the financial transaction is approved, that citizen cannot get a refund (and the summoned vehicle should arrive within five minutes of the specified starting time). Once the customer boards the vehicle, that vehicle will estimate the shortest, least traffic dense, and most fuel efficient path towards the specified destination point.</p>
<p>Standard self-driving and ownerless vehicles are cars which travel along designated roadways only. Other types of self-driving and ownerless vehicles take the form of boats (for traveling along the surface of a body of water), submarines (for traveling beneath the surface of a body of water), air crafts (for traveling through the atmosphere far above the ground), and spaceships (for traveling from one planet or satellite to some other planet or satellite).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Stem-Cell Derived Tissues and Organs, Prosthetic Limbs, and Brain-to-Computer Interfaces</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Every citizen is entitled to receive as many tissue replacement operations as needed (which are performed by a robot and/or human physician). <span style="background:#00ff00;">Replacement tissues are grown from a patient’s own <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a>.</span></p>
<p>In addition to receiving replacement body parts which are derived from a patient’s own stem cells, that patient is entitled to receive standard brain-to-computer interface installations and upgrades for free (as part of remaining a healthy and connected citizen inside of the technocratic system).</p>
<p>A citizen may be eligible to be retrofitted with prosthetic body parts which restore loss functionality and/or which augment functionality. Such upgrades range from being free to costing some natural number of sustainable energy tokens.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Pollution Free Energy Sources, Plant Based Consumable Goods, Lab Grown Meat, Sustainable Manufacturing, and Recycling at Least 90% of Material Waste</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Only pollution-free energy sources are legal to implement in an ideal technocracy.</p>
<p>All food sources are either derived from plants or else those food sources are grown from stem cells in a laboratory in a manner which prevents what are deemed to be sufficiently sentient organisms from being used as food, clothing, and other material commodities.</p>
<p>Ideally, almost zero toxic waste products and pollution are generated from civilization’s activities. Over ninety percent of materials used in manufacturing products are recycled to minimize having to mine for additional raw materials from the lithosphere of a planet and from asteroids.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Computer Generated Human Genomes, Gestating Human Embryos in Artificial Wombs, and Raising Human Children in Boarding Schools</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">All new human citizens in an ideal technocratic civilization are genetically programmed to not produce <strong>gametes</strong> (i.e. the haploid cells which manifest as either sperm cells or else as egg cells and which fuse to their complimentary opposite in order to form a zygote).</span> Each new human citizen starts as a lab-grown zygote which is produced from lab-grown gametes which are selected by a computer to exhibit the most desired heritable traits. That zygote is gestated in an artificial womb until that zygote is mature enough to leave the womb. After being ejected from the womb, the human infant is placed in a postnatal care center which employs robots and human staff to interact with the babies and to ensure that the babies are developing correctly.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the rate at which new human individuals are “minted” in the zygote formation and gestation facilities is calibrated by the Internet of Things to prevent overpopulation. (Ideally, each human individual gets to live for at least 700 years). If the Internet of Things decides that there is not a sufficiently high demand by humans for more humans to be “minted”, then the human-minting factory will cease production of new human citizens until there is a sufficiently high demand for more humans to be “minted”.</span></p>
<p>After the children are mature enough to attend school (at approximately two years old), those children are placed in boarding schools which are managed by robots and human staff. As the children mature, the children are given increasingly adult-like privileged and responsibilities. When the children attain approximately sixteen years of age and pass the exit exams adequately, those young adults are allowed to choose an apartment and to start living on its own (i.e. without a curfew, without travel restrictions, and with many more employment, educational, and recreational options than what a boarding school attendee would have access to).</p>
<p>Note that, although each citizen is guaranteed a universal basic income and unconditional access to basic necessities such as nutritious food, clean water, medical care, transportation, and housing, Internet access, and educational and recreational opportunities, citizens can earn extra vouchers for purchasing commodities which are normally paid for using sustainable energy tokens as a reward for volunteering as community service workers. (Note that more than 90% of the essential labor which keeps the civilization’s infrastructure in service and able to update is performed by robots and that most human jobs pertain to quality assurance, hospitality and entertainment, medical assistance, research and development, child care, assisting persons with special needs, educational assistance, and counseling).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">If there happen to be human inhabitants living inside the technocracy who are able to reproduce sexually, then nanobot drones will stealthily cause a miscarriage by administering abortion drugs within three days of a human individual becoming pregnant.</span></p>
