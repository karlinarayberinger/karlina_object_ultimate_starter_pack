<p><em>&#8220;At relatively microscopic levels of reality, there exist multiple minds occurring inside of one instance simultaneously such that those minds appear to be interacting with each other. At slightly higher levels of reality, there exist multiple of such instances occurring simultaneously. At the most macroscopic level of reality, there is only one mind which contains all of such instances.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</em></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">This ideas presented in this web page are an elaboration of the ideas presented in the web pages named <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGENCY</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/determinism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DETERMINISM</a>, and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATURE</a>. The basic premise of this web page is that nature is a <strong>multiverse</strong> comprised of all universes simultaneously such that nature can be metaphorically conceptualized as being a static &#8220;block&#8221; through which all imaginable space-time trajectories are &#8220;carved&#8221;.</span></p>

<p>In the diagram above, several types of hypothetical multiverses are depicted. Each bounded region filled with exactly one color represents exactly one space-time continuum (i.e. universe) which is either finite or else infinite in duration. Nested bounded regions depict the process of exactly one frame of reference abruptly transitioning from one space-time continuum to some other space-time continuum (such that an inner bounded region expands to become its neighboring outer bounded region).</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled D is a series of space-time continuums which evolves as time elapses to never repeat the same phenomena.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled A is a series of space-time continuums which repeats the same phenomena after a finite amount of time elapses in a cyclical manner.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled G is a space-time (i.e. universe) continuum which encompasses two multiverses simultaneously which are phenomenally indistinguishable from each other and which are each phenomenally similar to D.</p>
<p>The multiverse labeled F is a space-time continuum (i.e. universe) encompassing two multiverses simultaneously which are phenomenally distinguishable from each other such that one of those multiverses is a looping sequence of phenomena (similar to A) while the other multiverse is a diverging sequence of phenomena (similar to D).</p>
