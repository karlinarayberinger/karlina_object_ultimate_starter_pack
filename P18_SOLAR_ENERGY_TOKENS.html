<p><strong>SOLAR_ENERGY_TOKENS</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe a system of money whose notion of economic value is directly proportional to the number of watts of electricity produced by solar cells (and each one of those Solar Energy Tokens expires 12 &#8220;months&#8221; after being created). The name of the type of system described in this web page is <strong>Solar Energy Tokens Economy</strong>. A particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy may exist on a single satellite, an entire planet, or some other structure which exists inside of a finite allocation of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time</a>.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>N:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of persons which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and a <strong>person</strong> is a &#8220;arbitrarily intelligent&#8221; <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> (and each person which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy owns exactly one uniquely corresponding Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account)).</p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>&#8220;arbitrarily intelligent&#8221;</strong> in the context of this web page refers to a class of intelligence which is considered to be similar to humans according to most humans if humans are the most dominant species within an ecosystem which can be transformed into a Solar Energy Tokens Economy whose constituent Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account owners are each an individual member of that most dominant species. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(The author of this website expects all human individuals to either die or else transform into cyborgs by replacing each of their organic body parts with prosthetics and/or new organic body parts which are cloned from the human individual&#8217;s own <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a>).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>E:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watts</a> of electricity (and a <strong>watt</strong> is a joule of energy being transferred from one finite region of space to some other finite region of space across one second) which are generated from each one of the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photovoltaic cells</a> which sustain exactly one Solar Energy Tokens Economy during a particular &#8220;month&#8221; (and one <strong>&#8220;month&#8221;</strong> is exactly 30 days (and each <strong>day</strong> is exactly 24 hours (and each <strong>hour</strong> is exactly 60 minutes (and each <strong>minute</strong> is exactly 60 <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seconds</a>)))).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>S:</strong> a fixed <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural number</a> of watts of electricity which are used to produce exactly one Solar Energy Token (and a <strong>Solar Energy Token</strong> is a unit of abstract economic exchange (i.e. money) within a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and each Solar Energy Token is represented by exactly one unique and finite sequence of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/binary_to_decimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> across a network of digital computers)).</p>
<p>A unit of <strong>money</strong> is exactly one of some natural number of abstract homogeneously-typed objects which are used to symbolically represent a specific desired commodity.</p>
<p>A <strong>commodity</strong> is some kind of physical resource whose availability is finite and which persons want to utilize. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(A person can use money to reserve some commodity for that person&#8217;s exclusive use if that person pays to use that commodity before some other person pays to use that same commodity).</span></p>
<p>Within the context of the economies described in this web page, each Solar Energy Token Bank Account owner may trade some natural number of Solar Energy Tokens for a particular desired product or service whose price is equivalent to that natural number of Solar Energy Tokens.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">In order to prevent the subjective value of each Solar Energy Token from depreciating (i.e. starting from a positive value and then approaching zero) within a Solar Energy Tokens Economy as the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within that economy approaches <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinity</a>, each Solar Energy Token expires 12 &#8220;months&#8221; after that particular Solar Energy Token was generated. Once a particular Solar Energy Token expires, the unique binary digits sequence associated with that Solar Energy Token may be recycled as the unique identifier for some new Solar Energy Token.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>T:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of Solar Energy Tokens which were yielded from the E watts of electricity which were generated during a particular &#8220;month&#8221; within a particular Solar Energy Token Economy (and T is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing E by S).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>W:</strong> a natural number of Solar Energy Tokens to deposit into each one of the N Solar Energy Token Bank Accounts within a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy at some arbitrary transition point between two &#8220;months&#8221; (and W is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing T by N).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">W is the <strong>universal basic income</strong> amount of Solar Energy Tokens which each Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account receives from the government at the end of the &#8220;month&#8221; in which those Solar Energy Tokens were produced.</span></p>
<p>The dependent variable W may fluctuate across different months if either one of the independent variables N or E fluctuate across different months.</p>

<p>E will increase if (a0) the average solar cell efficiency increases within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy while (b0) the total number of solar cells does not decrease sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in solar cell efficiency within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy and while (c0) the intensity of the stellar light source powering those solar cells does not decrease sufficiently to cancel out the increase in solar cell efficiency.</p>
