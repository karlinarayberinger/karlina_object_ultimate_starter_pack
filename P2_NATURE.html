<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <strong>nature</strong> as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PURE_NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific features (and those features are observed as being finite quantities of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a> and <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a>).</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is the observation of the color <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">red</strong> by human brains which are processing input signals from optic nerves detecting light whose wavelengths are approximately 700 nanometers. (Where the color red is being observed by some partial frame of reference is where other colors such as <strong style="background:#000000;color:#0000ff;">blue</strong> and <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;">green</strong> are not simultaneously being observed by that same partial frame of reference).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> a particular allocation of pure nothingness which renders a particular set of phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PARTIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders some phenomena but not all phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>OMNISCIENT_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders all phenomena simultaneously.</p>
<p>At minimum, an omniscient frame of reference would render each partial frame of reference which currently exists simultaneously for as long as that omniscient frame of reference exists.</p>
<p>At maximum, an omniscient frame of reference would render each noumenon as that noumenon&#8217;s uniquely corresponding phenomenon eternally (such that the omniscient frame of reference would contain <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many unique phenomena and infinitely many copies of each unique phenomenon).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>For example, while a partial frame of reference named A renders a finite set of phenomena named X, another partial frame of reference named B renders a finite set of phenomena named Y (and X and Y are phenomenally distinct). From A’s perspective, Y is a noumenon while X is a phenomenon. From B’s perspective, X is a noumenon while Y is a phenomenon.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PANPSYCHISM:</strong> the hypothesis which suggests that the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness (and that ubiquitous field of consciousness is synonymous with pure nothingness).</p>
<p>Panpsychism, posits that there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders each phenomenon simultaneously (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness would be an omniscient frame of reference).</p>
<p>According to some variations of panpsychism, there hypothetically exists exactly one ubiquitous field of consciousness which renders each imaginable phenomenon simultaneously and immutably (which means that the ubiquitous field of consciousness would render each noumenon as that noumenon&#8217;s uniquely corresponding phenomenon eternally (such that an immortal and omniscient frame of reference would always contain infinitely many unique phenomena and infinitely many copies of each unique phenomenon such that each of those copies lasts changelessly forever within that immortal and omniscient frame of reference)).</p>
