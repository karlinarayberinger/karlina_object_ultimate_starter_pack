<p><strong>PROBABILITY</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The C++ program featured in this tutorial web page generates a dynamically-allocated one-dimensional array of int-type values named A and a dynamically-allocated two-dimensional array of int type values named B. A represents a contiguous block of memory consisting of exactly S int-sized contiguous chunks of memory (and S is a natural number). B represents a contiguous block of memory consisting of exactly T int-sized contiguous chunks of memory (and T is natural number). Each of the S int-sized chunks of memory comprising array A is assigned some random nonnegative integer value which is less than T. The elements of array B are each a one-dimensional array for storing exactly two int-type values.</span></p>
<p>The first int-type value of the ith subarray i of B (i.e. B[i][0]) represents a possible value occurring as an element of array A (such that int-sized memory chunk represented by B[i][0] stores the value i (and i is a nonnegative integer less than T)).</p>
<p>The second int-type value of the ith subarray of B (i.e. B[i][1]) represents the frequency at which i occurs as an element of array A (such that the int-sized memory chunk represented by B[i][1] stores the frequency at which i occurs as an element of array A (and B[i][1] is a nonnegative integer less than or equal to S)).</p>
<p>A histogram visually depicting the frequency array is printed to the command line and as write-only file output (along with statistics about such as the average value in A, the largest value in A, and the smallest value in A).</p>

<p><strong>Program Compilation &amp; Execution</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_ultimate_starter_pack/blob/main/probability.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>probability.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a Unix command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ probability.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following command to install the C++ compiler:</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number value, S, which is no larger than 1000 (and which will be used as the number of elements to include in an array of random integers):</pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for S using the using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: After a valid input value for S is entered, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number value, T, which is no larger than 1000 (and which will be used as the maximum number of unique states which each array element may represent):</pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_ultimate_starter_pack/blob/main/probability_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>
