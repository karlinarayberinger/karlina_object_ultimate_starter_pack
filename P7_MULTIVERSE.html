<p><strong>MULTIVERSE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a> as being a static “block” which contains all decision-making trajectories.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>STATIC:</strong> an adjective which describes some partition of nature as not changing according to some frame of reference observing that partition of nature.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>CHANGE:</strong> a noun which describes some frame of reference observing a particular phenomenon either emerging out of pure nothingness or else disappearing into pure nothingness.</p>
<p>In order for change to be observed, the same allocation of space being observed must be observed for some nonzero interval of time.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that change, and therefore the passage of time, is perceptible from a partial frame of reference but not from an omniscient frame of reference (because an omniscient frame of reference would observe all phenomena as occurring simultaneously and therefore timelessly).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SPACE_TIME_CONTINUUM:</strong> a linear succession of some natural number of (or else infinitely many) timeless snapshots of apparently one finite allocation of space.</p>
<p>A phenomenon occurring within a particular space-time continuum which does not appear to change as time elapses within that space-time continuum is considered to be a static phenomenon (according to the frame of reference which renders that space-time continuum).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UNIVERSE:</strong> exactly one space-time continuum which occurs inside of exactly one frame of reference.</p>
<p>If more than one universe exists, then a frame of reference which renders exactly one universe is considered to be <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partial</a> rather than omniscient because all other universes are excluded from that frame of reference.</p>
<p>If more than one universe exists, then a frame of reference which simultaneously renders each one of those universes is considered to be <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">omniscient</a> rather than partial.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>MULTIVERSE:</strong> the set which contains all universes.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there is exactly one immutable multiverse (and that multiverse may contain zero universes, some natural number of universes, or else indefinitely many universes).</p>
<p>If the words ensconced inside of this web page are currently being observed by any frame of reference, then at least one universe exists.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>MANY_WORLDS_HYPOTHESIS:</strong> the theory that more than one universe exists and that one universe branches into multiple phenomenally distinct universes whenever a decision is made inside of a parent universe.</p>
<p>Suppose some <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> is traveling through a maze and reaches a point in the maze where one path branches into two distinct paths. Suppose then that the information processing agent uses an algorithmic process of elimination to decide which one of those two paths is most useful to that information processing agent&#8217;s goals to traverse. If the information processing agent decides to traverse the left path, then, according to the many world&#8217;s hypothesis, in some parallel universe, a parallel version of that information processing agent has chosen to traverse the right path instead of the left path.</p>
