 * a particular function call chain which is initiated when this function is called
 * inside the scope in which C is declared.
 * 
 * If this function is going to be called more than one time from inside of the same
 * scope in which C is declared, C will need to be reset to 0 before each of those
 * function calls is implented to ensure that C stores the correct number of time this 
 * function calls itself during a particular function call from within C's program scope.
 * 
 * For each function call, print an algebraic expression which represents the Nth term of the Fibonacci Sequence.
